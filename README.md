# Lab 4
This lab mainly focuses on making interactive map with geojson file from given data.

## Details on Data Visualization
I changed my color scheme from OrRd which is adopted in the example population density to Greens, since I believe more vaccination rate represents more safety against virus.

## Classification
I used natural breaks that reduces the variance within classes and maximizes the variance between classes.
One question is that compared to the customized classification method used, which one is better and how should we decide which classifcation method to use when given random dataset?
